                Iconic landmarks like the Taj Mahal and ancient cities like Varanasi reflect its historical significance and architectural brilliance.

                Pakistan, with its rich tapestry of ethnicities, showcases a blend of cultural influences from Persian, Central Asian, and Indian traditions. 
                The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world’s oldest, still resonates in the country’s archaeological sites, while the vibrant arts and crafts of regions like Sindh and Punjab reveal a deep-rooted heritage.
                <br><br>
                Bangladesh, known for its lush landscapes and riverine beauty, boasts a strong tradition of folk music and vibrant textiles, particularly its renowned muslin.
