        <b>Geaography and Climate</b><br>
        India’s geography is incredibly varied, encompassing mountains, plains, deserts, and coastlines. The northern boundary is marked by the majestic Himalayas, home to some of the highest peaks in the world, including Kanchenjunga and Nanga Parbat. The Indo-Gangetic Plain, stretching across the northern states, is one of the most fertile agricultural regions globally.
        The climate in India is equally diverse, influenced by its vast size and geographical features. The country experiences four primary seasons: winter (December to February), summer (March to June), the monsoon (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November). The southern regions, including Kerala and Tamil Nadu, enjoy a tropical climate, while northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh experience extreme temperatures. The southwest monsoon plays a crucial role in replenishing water resources and supporting agriculture.

        The country boasts numerous UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as the Taj Mahal, Jaipur City, and the temples of Khajuraho, showcasing its architectural and artistic grandeur. Festivals like Diwali, Eid, Holi, and Christmas reflect the country’s religious diversity and cultural vibrancy, often celebrated with elaborate rituals, music, and dance.
